The proposed network was constructed using SpykeTorch, a PyTorch-based simulator of convolutional spiking neural networks (Mozafari et al. ,2019).  (Mozafari et al., 2019)

We made change to the learning rule by replacing the classical learning rule in the SpykeTorch snn.py class with Tavanaei's probabilistic learning rule
